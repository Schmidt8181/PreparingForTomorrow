# ThinkfulCapstone
Final capstone for Thinkful Data Science bootcamp


# Project Description
This is the final capstone project for the Thinkful Data Science track bootcamp. This project brings together and showcases the knowledge learned in the rest of the course, and will allow me to showcase my abilities within the various areas of 'data science'. Within this project, I will be taking data spanning from 1990-2018 of 5 different food incdices tracked by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and transforming and analyzing it to forecast the future behavior of said indices. I will then take those forecasts and feed them into a dashboard for easy viewing and understanding. This project is geared towards Chefs running small to moderate sized kitchens who are negatively impacted by fluctiations in the food market. 

# Data
The data for this project is gathered from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The dataset can be retrieved from http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/. 

# Dashboard
The dashboard is designed to allow the user to choose which index they would like to view and then display the current index price with previous 6 months worth of measurements and then display the next month(s) forecasted prices. 

# Results


# Next Steps
A few ideas for next steps are to gather and incorporate additional data to search for additional predictors for movement of each index. Global temperature readings, flooding reports & locations, drought reports & locations are just the first few  that come to mind.
