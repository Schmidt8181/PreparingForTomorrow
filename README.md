# Project Description
This project is geared towards chefs running small to moderate sized kitchens who are negatively impacted by fluctuations in market prices. This project will utilize freely available datasets from the FAO of the UN and GISS to predict market movement. 

# Data
The data is gathered from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The datasets can be found on http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/ and https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/. 

# Dashboard
The dashboard is designed to allow the user to choose which index they would like to view and then display the current index price with previous 6 months worth of measurements and then display the next months forecasted values. 

# Results


# Next Steps
A few ideas for next steps are to gather and incorporate additional data to search for additional predictors for movement of each index. Global flooding reports & locations, drought reports & locations are just the first few  that come to mind.
